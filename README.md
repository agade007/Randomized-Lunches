Arkadium conducts Hackathons/Jamming sessions twice a year so as to empower innovation and problem solving skills
This year's 2-day Hackathon was aimed at improving the product experience of Arkadum through cross functional collaboration
My team included people from sales/business development, people ops, marketing, and myself from analytics. We came up with bunch of ideas , one such idea being : <br>
<br><b>Randomized_lunches </b><ul>
  Aim of the project was to build cross functional relationships through lunch outings.
  I was given about 8 sets of names with each set being a particular team (for example: Analytics, sales etc.). Desired outcome was to create set of 4 random names making sure the names do not belong to the same set/team and are not repeated in the next outcome. I used a simple random() from Math library to generate random name iterating it over a loop with length=4  and conitional statement to make sure the name does not generate again.<br><br>
  For example:
    We have A(Adi,John) B(Sam,Vivian,Remi) C(Adrian,Johnathan,Lee,Sunny), D(Jessica, Kenny)
    The function randomEl(list) generates --> Adi, Vivian, Lee, Jessica
    Also to avoid confusion, I have included last names as well in the program. You can view the output on the website mentioned above.
   </ul>
